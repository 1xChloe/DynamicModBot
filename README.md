Remove the temp.txt file in dbs/Guilds to use
This is a dynamic cross-server capable moderation bot that is as full featured as I had the time for, you can use it for your own server or etc. All I ask is do not use this to scale up to a bigger bot (At least not without some form of involvement from me!)
